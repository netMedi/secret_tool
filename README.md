# secret_tool

The tool to contextually handle environment variables and secrets in a secure way.

![Architectural overview](./docs/overview.svg)

The secret_tool translates entities from 1Password into `.env.*` files for local development flow. `secret_map.yml` (or a collection of files from `./secret_map.yml.d`) is used to structure the approach and, when needed, transform secret values into usable entities (from strings, since env files can only contain string values).

## Flow

1. Reads configuration from `secret_map.yml` or `secret_map.yml.d/*.yml`
2. Fetches secrets from 1Password using configured mappings
3. Transforms values if needed (using defined transformers)
4. Writes resulting key-value pairs to specified `.env.*` files

## Requirements

<table><tbody><tr><th>TLDR:</th><td>

Make sure [1password-cli](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/), [bun](https://bun.sh/) and [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/docs/install) are installed as SYSTEM packages.

### Hard

- dash / ash / bash / zsh - command shell (present in the system by default, do not worry about this; dash, however, is the fastest and also POSIX compliant ðŸ˜‰)
- [1password-cli](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/) - SECRETS' handling
- bun - building the binary (make sure to **read the log output** after you [install Bun](https://bun.sh/), an additional step may be needed for _zsh_, which is the default shell for MacOS and some Linux distros); on some Linux distros you may get away with compiling secret_tool via podman/docker [bun image](https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun), but MacOS does not seem to be one of those distros, so make sure [bun](https://bun.sh/) is installed.

### Soft

- [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/docs/install) (!!! dotenvx has several installation methods, be sure to perform an Npm **global install** !!!) - commands' wrapper
- git - updates (chances are you do have it installed already, but, if you are just starting, find [the official guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to proceed)

## 1password Vault variables

Save secret_tool's version number to personal (a.k.a. Employee) 1password vault as item named SECRET_TOOL:

- New Item > Software License
- Rename "Software License" to "SECRET_TOOL" (this will be the name of a new entry)
- (optionally) remove all fields except of "version"
- Set the value of the "version" field (version of secret_tool you want to install; ex: "latest")
  (replace "latest" with "2.6.0", for example, if you want to stick to pinned releases)

## First time [install]

- clone this project's repo
- cd into this project's root dir
- `./secret_utils.sh install`

## CI install

Declare install_secret_tool block at the top level of `.circleci/config.yml`

```sh
commands:

  # ... other commands ...

  install_secret_tool:
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Install secret_tool
          command: |
            if [ -z "$(command -v secret_tool)" ]; then
              npm install -g bun 2> /dev/null || sudo npm install -g bun

              #VERSION=$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/netMedi/secret_tool/releases/latest | jq -r ".tag_name")
              VERSION=v2.6.0 # for a chosen tagged release (replace version number)

              export SKIP_OP_USE=1
              rm -rf /tmp/secret_tool 2> /dev/null || true
              touch ~/.ssh/known_hosts 2> /dev/null || true
              ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
              git clone git@github.com:netMedi/secret_tool.git /tmp/secret_tool
              cd /tmp/secret_tool
              git checkout $VERSION
              bun install 2> /dev/null || true
              ./secret_utils.sh install
              cd ~

              rm -rf /tmp/secret_tool
            else
              secret_tool --version
            fi

  # ... other commands ...
```

Whenever you need `secret_tool` installed in the context, include it as a step:

```yml
steps:
  # other steps
  - install_secret_tool
```

## Update

There are a couple of automated ways to update secret_tool.

1. The latest revision of main:

```sh
  # latest revision of main branch
  secret_tool --update
```

2. Exact tag:

```sh
  # install exact release tag of main branch
  VERSION=v2.6.0 secret_tool --update
```

3. The latest tag (stable)

```sh
  # install the latest tagged release (stable)
  VERSION=latest secret_tool --update

  # or
  VERSION=stable secret_tool --update
```

## Running with up-to-date secrets

- go to target project
- perform `secret_tool <profile_name(s)>` to produce .env.\* file(s):

```sh
secret_tool my_profile_name another_profile

# or

EXTRACT='my_profile_name another_profile' secret_tool
```

## Input format (naming and conventions)

Secret map can either be written as a configmap or a flat envfile (or a mix of those).

Configmap keys are usually lower_case while flat env variables are all UPPER_CASE.

Mixing those or writing in an inappropriate case is not critical and will only affect human-readability of a secret map.

Nesting is either done in yaml manner (by literal nesting) or using double underscore (`__`) delimiter.

```yaml
---
tool_version: 2.6.0
profiles:
  my_C00L_profile:
    --format: yml # optional output format; envfile by default, yml or json
    some_typical_configmap:
      conf1:
        - val1
        - val2
        - val3
    USUAL_ENV__VAR_VAL: asdf
# ^ a totally valid map including a mixture of input formats
```

If profile name contains slashes (`/`), it will be treated as output file path. Alternatively you can use `--prefix` property of a profile.

### Where to place custom secret profiles

Profiles for common use shall be placed into the `secret_map.yml` itself.

Custom profiles for personal use can be placed wherever, but will be automagically loaded from `./secret_map.yml.d/` directory at the same level in the project. Alternatively you can refer to them by SECRET_MAP env variable: space separated list of files or masks (example command: `SECRET_MAP='~/my_maps/*.yml ~/Downloads/shared_map_from_teammate.yml' secret_tool --all`).

```sh
mikko@macbook-a2442:~/netMedi/secret_tool$ tree -L 2 ~/netMedi/Holvikaari | grep '\.yml'
# <output trimmed>
â”œâ”€â”€ secret_map.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ secret_map.yml.d
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my_random_profile1.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ my_random_profile2.yml
mikko@macbooka2442:~/netMedi/secret_tool$
```

### Inline arrays

If you need to declare an array you have a few options:

1. Use YAML arrays:

```yaml
my_array:
  - one
  - two
  - three
```

2. Use JSON array notation for YAML:

```yaml
my_array: ['one', 'two', 'three']
```

3. Use a comma-separated string variable (parse later in the code):
   (this one is useful if code will work with raw value of env variable)

```yaml
my_arrayish_string: 'one,two,three'
```

4. [Special cases] array of quoted values
   (this one is used, for example, in `postgres` container image environment: `POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES`)

```yaml
my_special_string: '"quoted value 1","quoted value 2","quoted value 3"'
```

## Ouput format (machine- or human-readable)

secret_tool supports three output formats: `envfile` (default), `yml` and `json`, which is defined in each profile via a `--format` attribute. It can be abbreviated down to one letter.

[!] Make sure to end `FILE_NAME_BASE` with a slash (`/`), if you want it to be a directory.

By default any existing output file with the same name will get renamed into file postfixed with `.YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss.bak`. This sort of backup can be skipped by setting `LIVE_DANGEROUSLY=1`.

## Local overrides

If you need to apply values other than the ones secret_map provides, you have a few options:

1. Edit output file directly.
2. Set variables as shell defaults in your .bashrc / .zshrc / .zprofile etc.
3. Export variable for the current terminal session (ex: `export MY_CUSTOM_VAR=123`)
4. Set variable value inline prior to the command (ex: `MY_CUSTOM_VAR=123 secret_tool dev`)

[!] Option 1 allows you to set the value as clear text only.

[!] Options 2-4, however, allow you to make 1password references into use (ex: `MY_CUSTOM_VAR=':::op://Employee/MY_OVERRIDES/custom' secret_tool dev`) and that value will be dynamically evaluated at assignment. To discard some of the values set by secret_map, you can use literals for empty string, array and object: `!!` (discard whatever value present in secret_map), `!![]` (set value to empty array) and `!!{}` (set value to empty object).

Example:

```sh
MY_VAR='!!' secret_tool dev # forcefully write empty value for MY_VAR
```

## Last time [uninstall]

- cd into this project's root dir
- `./secret_utils.sh uninstall`
- remove this project's repo

## Creating your own secret_map / integration for new projects

- go to target project's root dir and create `secret_map.yml` (you can use [tests/secret_map.yml](./tests/secret_map.yml) as a starting point)
- [gitignore /.env\*](.gitignore) to prevent accidental secret file submission to git
- if necessary, include non-gitignored contextual overrides via .env.\* files with the same profile names (refer to Katedraali packages for examples)
- rewrite package.json commands with `dotenvx run -f ...` wrapper and make sure to include all relevant profiles that are required for command (example: `"test": "dotenvx run -f ../../.env.test -f .env.test -- jest"` - package-level script would load global defaults and package-level .env files)
- produce .env.\* files and check if all required variables are present
- commit your changes to target project

### [!] Avoid using dots `[.]` in profile names. You can use alphanum characters `[A-z0-9]`, dash `[-]` and underscore `[_]`.

Profiles starting with double-dash are considered internal templates and therefore are not displayed for `secret_tool --profiles`.

### PROFILE inheritance

Secret map profiles support inheritance. You do not have to redeclare repeating values again if they are already defined in existing profile. Instead define the source profile with `--extend` field at target profile's root level. For example, if you need to create a close derivative of "dev" profile adding a few extra variables on top, you may extend it via the `--extend` field:

```yaml
# ...

# dev profile, will output to own path
dev:
  var1: 1
  var2: b
  var3: c

# will extend dev and output to dev-extended path
dev-extended:
  --extend: dev
  var3: new value
  var4: new variable

# will extend dev and output to dev (ovewriting default dev output file)
dev-overridden:
  --extend: dev
  --name: dev
  var1: 11
```

[Note] `--prefix`, `--name` and `--postfix` are customisation values allowing you to tweak output file path. Otherwise those are calculated from profile name. This is especially useful for custom override profiles that are intended to write at the same path as their integral profile.

[Note] While YAML natively supports overriding fields by using anchors `&name` and `<<: *name` notation, this would replace the whole block, so `--extend` field provides a more flexible approach when merging is desired.

## Modifying secret_tool scripts

[!] Recommended VS Code extensions: `oven.bun-vscode`.

You can run secret_tool without compiling it. Use `bun src_run` or `./secret_utils.sh src_run`.
To start utils you can have two options: `bun utils` and `./secret_utils.sh`.

After making changes verify shell scripts with shellcheck (`./.posix_verify.sh`) and TypeScript with linter (eslint).

# Example of custom profile for a non-default environment

_Using Holvikaari staging-miracle_

0. Install secret_tool as per the above instructions.

1. Open Holvikaari project directory
   `cd ~/netMedi/Holvikaari/`

2. Declare a custom profile at `./secret_map.yml.d/staging-miracle.yml`:

```yaml
---
profiles:
  staging-miracle:
    --extend: dev
    SITE: staging-miracle
  config/secrets/staging-miracle:
    --extends: config/secrets/dummy
```

3. Prepare the profile(s):

```sh
secret_tool staging-miracle config/secrets/staging-miracle
```

[!] If you declared profile(s) incorrectly, you will get a validation error.

Now you have one new PROFILE [`staging-miracle`] and one new SECRET_PROFILE [`staging-miracle`]. Usually they go together and you do not need to specify SECRET_PROFILE explicitly, but you can. For example, if you want different keycloak endpoint.

4. Initiate the databases

```sh
PROFILE=staging-miracle yarn s:db:setup
```

5. Start Holvikaari with a new profile:

```sh
PROFILE=staging-miracle yarn s:all:start

# or separately backend and frontend if that is your preference
export PROFILE=staging-miracle
yarn s:backend:start
yarn s:frontend:start
```
